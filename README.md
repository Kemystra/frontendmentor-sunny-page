## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

### What I learned

1. CSS Orders
I can specify which order an element should be in a flexbox!
```css
#first-div {
    order: 2;
}

#second-div {
    order: 1;
}
```

2. CSS Clip Path
Can be used to crop pictures into desired shapes.
```css
#image {
    // Crop image into a circle of 50% radius
    // right at the center
    clip-path: circle(50% at 50% 50%)
}
```

### Useful resources

- [CSS Tricks: How to Scale SVG](https://css-tricks.com/scale-svg/) - Helped me in finding ways to resizing SVGs, which is used in the site's logo.
-[CSS Tricks: Approaches to Media Queries in Sass](https://css-tricks.com/approaches-media-queries-sass/) - Really opened my eyes to the true power of SASS; I was just a casual @mixin user until now.
- [MDN Web Docs on CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) - Too much to list here but I just want to mention on the abundant methods to use justify-* with Flexbox.
